    <h1>What Causes Weather?</h1>
    <p>Weather is made up of six main components. These are temperature, atmospheric pressure, cloud formation, wind, humidity and rain. A small change to any of these conditions can create a different weather pattern. Every weather pattern has a knock-on effect, creating a ripple effect around the world. That’s why weather can sometimes seem chaotic. It’s constantly changing.</p>
    <h2>Temperature:</h2>
    <p>Temperature describes how hot or cold the atmosphere is. The atmosphere absorbs heat energy from the sun. But human activities, such as releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, can also affect the earth’s temperature.</p>
    <h3>Atmospheric Pressure:</h3>
    <p>Atmospheric pressure is a result of the weight and density of the air. Atmospheric pressure changes as air becomes warmer or colder, because the temperature of air affects how dense it is. Warm air molecules have more energy and move further apart, meaning that warm air is less dense than cold air. Atmospheric pressure also decreases as you move higher into the atmosphere. Imagine the atmosphere as a huge ocean of air that we live underneath. The pressure underneath the weight of the entire ocean is far greater than the pressure near the ocean’s surface. That’s why atmospheric pressure decreases as you move higher in the atmosphere. High-pressure weather systems tend to bring cooler temperatures and clear skies. On the other hand, low-pressure weather systems bring warm temperatures and more unsettled weather. </p>
    <h4>Clouds:</h4>
    <p>Clouds are visible masses of water vapour in our atmosphere. They are formed when water evaporates from places like oceans and lakes, and then condenses when it cools down again. </p>
    <h5>Wind:</h5>
    <p>Wind is the movement of air in the sky. Wind is caused by the different air pressures in our atmosphere. Air from areas of high pressure tries to move into areas of low pressure. The greater the difference between the air pressure, the faster the air moves between the two areas.</p>
    <h6>Humidity:</h6>
    <p>Humidity describes the amount of water vapor in the air. Water vapour makes up anywhere between 0.1% and 4% of the gases in our atmosphere. Warmer air can carry more water vapour than cooler air, which is why warm tropical climates often feel sticky.</p>
